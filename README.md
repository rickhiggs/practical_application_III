# practical_application_III
Assignment from Berkeley-Hass / Emeritus ML/AI course.

This exercise goal is to identify the features from a dataset that best predict if an individual will accept and offer to make a deposit to a new bank account.  The outcome shows people over 60 are much more likely to accept the offer.  The other features in the data set did not significantly separate those who are more likely to make a deposit from those that will not.
